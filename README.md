## 🌐 Introduction

🚀 **PhysLab is the first video dataset for visual parsing of physics experimental processes!**

🚀 **We provide rich multi-level annotations to support diverse computer vision research!**

🚀 **Benchmark results on eight core vision tasks are established for comparison and reference!**

### 📝 Statistics

The PhysLab dataset contains 620 long videos of four physical experiments, covering 3873 action clips of 32 types of actions, with an average length of 20 seconds per clip and a video frame rate of 30FPS. It subset provides valuable resources for video temporal research such as temporal action proposal, action classification, action alignment, and action segmentation.

## 📣 Note

At present, we have completely completed the annotation of action classification, temporal action detection, action recognition, object detection, occlusion detection, human-object interaction detection, and instance segmentation related research. The annotation of visual text alignment is still in progress. We will release and provide benchmark performance in a timely manner.

At present, we are integrating multiple types of annotations and achieving accurate alignment between them. We have provided some samples for reference. The complete data is expected to be released within three months. Please continue to follow our dynamics.

At present, we are supplementing data samples of six other experimental types and building collection devices for chemical and biological experiments.
